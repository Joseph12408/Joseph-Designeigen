### What I worked on yesterday
- Completed HTML and CSS structure for the subscription section.
- Added color schemes.

### What I'll be focusing on today
- Box shadows, button shadows, and navigation bar line as seen in the design.
- Testing visual alignment and font implementation.

### Some challenges I faced / questions that I have
- Had difficulty matching exact color shades without resarch; used approximate hex codes.
- Unsure if the navigation bar line should be slightly darker for better contrast.
